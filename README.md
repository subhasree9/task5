In this task, I worked on the Heart Disease dataset and applied Decision Tree and Random Forest models for classification.
The main aim was to understand how tree-based models work and how Random Forest improves performance compared to a single Decision Tree.
## What I Did
* Loaded the dataset using pandas
* Checked dataset shape and basic details
* Split data into training and testing sets
* Trained a Decision Tree classifier
* Calculated accuracy and printed classification report
* Controlled overfitting using max_depth
* Visualized the decision tree
* Trained a Random Forest model
* Compared accuracy of both models
* Plotted feature importance graph
* Performed cross-validation
## What I Observed
* Random Forest gave better accuracy than Decision Tree.
* Limiting tree depth helped reduce overfitting.
* Some features were more important in predicting heart disease.
## Tools Used
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* VS Code
## Conclusion
This task helped me understand how Decision Trees split data and how Random Forest combines multiple trees to improve accuracy. I also learned about overfitting and feature importance.
